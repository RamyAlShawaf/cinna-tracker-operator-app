# Cinna Tracker Operator App

MVP operator flow:
- Open app → Scan bus QR (gets public_code)
- Start session → backend returns publish token
- Begin tracking → background location stream sends pings every few seconds
- End trip → closes session

Run

```
# 1) Make sure you're in the correct folder (underscores, not hyphens)
cd /Users/ramy/Documents/Personal/Cinna/Github/cinna_tracker_operator_app

# 2) iOS simulator (localhost works)
flutter run -d ios --dart-define=BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# OR Android emulator (use 10.0.2.2 for host machine localhost)
flutter run -d android --dart-define=BACKEND_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3000

# OR physical device on same Wi‑Fi (replace with your Mac's LAN IP)
flutter run --dart-define=BACKEND_URL=http://192.168.x.x:3000
```
